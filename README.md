## Overview

The topic for our final project involves analyzing video game trends to better understand what makes them successful upon release.

Our group quickly realized we were assembled based on our passion for video games, so picking our research topic was not so demanding. The Steam platform is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, and is a fantastic resource for examining gaming trends over the last decade. We will imagine that we have been approached by a company that plans to develop and release a new title on Steam's library. Our analyses will function as a valuable asset that may inform decisions regarding the company's budget and timing of release.

## Data References

Our dataset was downloaded from Kaggle in JSON format, and provides us with various information about games offered in the Steam store.

The primary dataset provides some useful columns that we can eventually turn into features for analysis. These include any column's that reference a game's success. This can be measured by critic scores, recommendations, reviews, along with average-play time. There are categories and genres columns that we will need to decide how to use, but they stand out as potential features among the remaining columns.

Some decisions will be decided within the later stages of the project. With the data downloaded, this stage is now complete. In the next step, we'll take care of preparing and cleaning the data, readying a complete data set to use for analysis.

### Technologies Used

#### Data Cleaning and Analysis

Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform any exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

#### Database Storage

PostgreSQL is the database management system that we plan to use to store our cleaned datasets.

#### Machine Learning

SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier.

#### Dashboard

Our dashboard will be made within R using the Shiny package, but is subject to change.
